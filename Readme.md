# Project Overview

This project is a well-designed backend system that aims to work like platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. It is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, and includes user authentication using JWT and bcrypt for secure login and registration. This project aims to have all the important features of a strong backend, creating a complete video hosting website similar to YouTube, with features like login, signup, video upload (using Cloudinary), likes, dislikes, comments, replies, subscriptions, and more.
